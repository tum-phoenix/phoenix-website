      <p>
        Welcome to the TUMaverick team page, your source for the latest updates and information on
        our autonomous driving project for the Bosch Future Mobility Challenge 2023. We are a group
        of passionate students from Technical University of Munich (TUM) who share a common goal of
        developing cutting-edge autonomous driving and connectivity algorithms. Our team is part of
        TUM Phoenix Robotics, which is the first independent student group exploring the fascinating
        possibilities of robotics at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering.<br />
        <br />
        As part of the Bosch Future Mobility Challenge, we are working diligently to develop
        state-of-the-art algorithms to navigate our 1:10 scale vehicles in a miniature smart city
        environment. Our team is made up of talented and passionate students from the Technical
        University of Munich, who are committed to pushing the boundaries of what&apos;s possible in
        the world of autonomous driving and connectivity. With the support of Bosch Engineering
        Center Club and academic professors, we are developing cutting-edge algorithms and
        technologies that will pave the way for the future of mobility.<br />
        Our team is excited to participate in the finals of the Bosch Future Mobility Challenge and
        showcase our hard work to the world. With the support of Bosch experts and academic
        professors, we are confident that we can deliver exceptional results. We are determined to
        push the limits of autonomous driving and connectivity, and we hope to inspire others to
        join us in this exciting journey.<br />
        Stay tuned for updates on our progress and follow us on social media to learn more about our
        team and the TUM Phoenix Robotics student club. Thank you for your support!<br />

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Our approach to the Bosch Future Mobility Challenge is focused on collaboration,
          innovation, and excellence. We work closely with Bosch experts and academic professors to
          develop cutting-edge algorithms and technologies that will enable our vehicle to navigate
          and communicate with its environment effectively.<br />
          We also place a strong emphasis on teamwork and communication within our own team,
          ensuring that everyone is working towards a common goal and sharing their knowledge and
          expertise to achieve the best possible results.

        <h2>Project Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Our project architecture is designed to enable our vehicle to navigate and communicate
          with its environment in a safe and efficient way. We have divided our project into several
          modules, each of which focuses on a different aspect of autonomous driving and
          connectivity. These modules include:
          <ul>
            <li>Behavior and Motion Planning</li>
            <li>Perception and Scene Understanding</li>
            <li>Sensing and Input Vehicle Actuation</li>
            <li>Communication and Connectivity</li>
            <li>Human-Machine Interface</li>
          </ul>
          We are constantly testing and optimizing our modules to ensure that they are working
          together seamlessly and providing the best possible performance.
