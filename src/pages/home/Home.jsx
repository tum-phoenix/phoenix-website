        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>We are the Phoenix Robotics student club at TUM. A passionate team of students from
          various
          disciplines working together to build autonomous model cars and drones supported by the
          Chair of Automatic Control and the Institute of Flight System Dynamics. In our lab in the
          mechanical engineering building, we work on everything starting at low-level engineering
          to
          high-level software like flight control and AI.</p>

        <p> Our award-winning Drive Team is working on the next big thing, Autonomous Driving with
          the self-made 1:10 scale car.
          One of the highlights is the yearly participation at the <a
            href="https://www.epc.ed.tum.de/phoenix/autonomous-drive/carolo-cup/"
          >Carolo Cup </a> in
          Braunschweig.

        <p> The Flight Team concentrates on drones. Current projects include programming a drone
          to
          act like the Snatch from Harry Potterâ€™s Quidditch game.
          Various technologies like Reinforced Learning help in avoiding obstacles and flying
          safely.
